"""The per-case provenance sidecar: where a case came from and how it was verified.

DataStorage is the source of truth for WHICH cases exist (a case is a directory
with a genData.json -- /getCases has always worked that way). What a bare directory
cannot say is where it came from: which repository, which archive, which checksum.
That is this sidecar's job: clews-provenance.json inside the case directory.

It rides inside the case deliberately. backupCase zips the whole case directory and
the importer restores everything, so provenance survives export -> hand-off ->
restore, and the receiving machine can still verify what it got.

All reads are tolerant: a missing or corrupt sidecar means "no provenance", never
an error -- plenty of perfectly good cases predate this file.
